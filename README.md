# ecma6-angular

A project to test out the new functionalities provided by EcmaScript 6. Translation is done by Babel. Some of the translations could not be made by the then current build of Babel, so expect some pages to throw some errors.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
